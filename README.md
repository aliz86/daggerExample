if module needs a parameter:
val appComponent = DaggerApplicationComponent//.create()
.builder()
.myFirstDiModule(MyFirstDiModule(100))  //Refer to  --> class MyFirstDiModule (/*i : Int*/) {
.build()

if it doesn't:
val appComponent2 = DaggerApplicationComponent.create()

And also to avoid the boiler code, you can use @Component.Factory:  with @Component.Factory, you don’t need to define a separate method for each dependency in the builder. You just define a single method in the factory that takes all the dependencies as parameters.

Explanation:

When you use DaggerAppComponent.create(), Dagger can automatically construct your dependencies for you, but it can only do this for dependencies that it knows how to construct. If you have dependencies that Dagger doesn’t know how to construct (like runtime dependencies), you would need to use a builder and define a method for each dependency. This can get verbose if you have many such dependencies.

On the other hand, with @Component.Factory, you can define a single method that takes all these dependencies as parameters. This is where the reduction in verbosity comes in. It’s not about the creation of the component itself, but about how you bind instances to the component.

Here’s an example to illustrate this:

Without @Component.Factory, you might do something like this:

Kotlin

@Component
interface AppComponent {
fun inject(application: Application)

    @Component.Builder
    interface Builder {
        @BindsInstance
        fun application(application: Application): Builder

        @BindsInstance
        fun someDependency(someDependency: SomeDependency): Builder

        // ... more methods for each dependency

        fun build(): AppComponent
    }
}

// And then you'd create the component like this:
val component = DaggerAppComponent.builder()
.application(application)
.someDependency(someDependency)
// ... more calls for each dependency
.build()
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
With @Component.Factory, you can do this instead:

Kotlin

@Component
interface AppComponent {
fun inject(application: Application)

    @Component.Factory
    interface Factory {
        fun create(@BindsInstance application: Application, @BindsInstance someDependency: SomeDependency): AppComponent
    }
}

// And then you'd create the component like this:
val component = DaggerAppComponent.factory().create(application, someDependency)
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
As you can see, with @Component.Factory, you don’t need to define a separate method for each dependency in the builder. You just define a single method in the factory that takes all the dependencies as parameters. This is why we say that @Component.Factory is less verbose when you need to bind instances to the component.


---------------------------------------------------------
Dagger Scope:
A scoped object will share the lifecycle of the component of the same scope.
in below sample, same goes with a component which is initiated in ClassB, doesn't need to be necessarily a "component".
So If we have a component named "ApplicationComponent" and then a subcomponent named "ActivityComponent" (They are just names, no standard class with these names exist) with scope "ActivityScope". If we initiate and start this subcomponent (or component, doesn't matter) in a ClassB class (e.g., Activity Class), when the ClassB instance is Garbage Collected, or if that subcomponent is set to null, the objects with the same scope will be null, too. It is like creating Singletons with scopes, being bound to certain classes.
---------------------------------------------------------

Steps to create a custom scope with dagger:

build.gradle dependencies:

plugins {
id("com.android.application")
id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.android")
id("kotlin-kapt")
}

//dependencies:
    implementation ("com.google.dagger:dagger:2.48.1")
    kapt ("com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.48.1")

```kotlin
import dagger.Component
import dagger.Module
import dagger.Provides
import javax.inject.Inject
import javax.inject.Scope

// 1. Define a custom scope annotation
@Scope
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class ActivityScope

// 2. Create a module that provides objects within the defined scope
@Module
class ActivityModule {

    @ActivityScope
    @Provides
    fun provideSomeObject(): SomeObject {
        return SomeObject()
    }
}

// 3. Create a component that uses the scope
@ActivityScope
@Component(modules = [ActivityModule::class])
interface ActivityComponent {
    fun inject(activity: MainActivity)
}

// 4. Create a class that will use the injected object
class SomeObject @Inject constructor() {
    fun doSomething(): String {
        return "Something"
    }
}

// 5. Example activity using the component and injected object
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    @Inject lateinit var someObject: SomeObject

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        // ...

        // Obtain the component and inject dependencies
        val component = DaggerActivityComponent.create()
        component.inject(this)

        // Use the injected object
        val result = someObject.doSomething()
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define a Custom Scope:**
    - We create a custom annotation marked with `@Scope`. This annotation will be used to define the lifecycle of objects associated with it.

2. **Module with Scoped Provides:**
    - Inside `ActivityModule`, the `@Provides` method for `SomeObject` is annotated with `@ActivityScope`. This means whenever Dagger needs to provide an instance of `SomeObject` within the `ActivityScope`, it will use this method and reuse the same instance within that scope.

3. **Component with Scope:**
    - The `ActivityComponent` is annotated with `@ActivityScope`. This binds the component's lifecycle to the scope.

4. **Class using Injection:**
    - `SomeObject` is a regular class that utilizes constructor injection with `@Inject`.

5. **Activity Utilizing Component:**
    - Inside `MainActivity`, we obtain an instance of `ActivityComponent` using `DaggerActivityComponent.create()`.
    - We then inject the dependencies into the activity using `component.inject(this)`.
    - Finally, we can use the injected `someObject` instance.

**Key Points:**

- **Object Lifecycle:** The `ActivityScope` ensures that the same instance of `SomeObject` is provided throughout the lifecycle of an activity. If you inject `SomeObject` into different objects within the same activity, they will receive the same instance.
- **Scope Management:** You are responsible for managing the creation and destruction of component instances (e.g., creating it when the activity is created and destroying it when the activity is destroyed).
- **No Hilt:** This example demonstrates how to define scopes without using Hilt, giving you more control over the dependency graph.

This example demonstrates a basic implementation. You can define different scopes (e.g., `@ApplicationScope`, `@FragmentScope`) based on your application's requirements.




Why did you use @Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)?
You're right to ask! Using `@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)` on our custom scope annotation (`@ActivityScope` in this case) is crucial for Dagger to function correctly. Let's break down why:

**How Dagger uses Scopes**

Dagger relies heavily on annotations for dependency injection. Here's how scopes come into play:

1. **Marking Components and Modules:** When you annotate a component (e.g., `@ActivityScope @Component`) or a provider method within a module (e.g., `@ActivityScope @Provides`), you're telling Dagger about the intended lifecycle of the objects they provide.

2. **Runtime Reflection:** At runtime, Dagger uses reflection to analyze your code. It specifically looks for these scope annotations to understand:
   -  Which objects should have a limited lifecycle (scoped objects).
   - How to manage instances within a particular scope (e.g., creating a single instance per activity).

**Why `AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME` is Essential**

* **Availability at Runtime:**  `AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME` ensures that the scope annotation (like `@ActivityScope`) is not just present in your source code but is also available in the compiled `.class` files. This is essential because Dagger performs its reflection and dependency injection *at runtime*.

* **Without It:**
   - If you used `AnnotationRetention.SOURCE` (the default), the annotation would be discarded during compilation.  Dagger wouldn't be able to find it at runtime, and it would have no way to determine the intended scope of your components, modules, and provided objects. This would lead to unexpected behavior and likely injection errors.

**In short:**  `@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)` is not optional for Dagger scopes. It ensures that Dagger can properly interpret and enforce the lifecycles you define for your dependencies, making your dependency injection robust and predictable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
What is "reflection"?

In the context of programming and Dagger specifically, "reflection" refers to the ability of a program to examine and manipulate its own structure and metadata at runtime.

Here's a breakdown in simpler terms:

- **Imagine a Blueprint:** Think of your code (Kotlin in this case) as a blueprint for building a house (your app). The blueprint contains all the plans and details.

- **Building the House:** When you compile your code, it's like constructing the house based on the blueprint. The compiled code (.class files) is the actual structure you get.

- **Reflection: Looking Inside:** Reflection is like having the ability to go inside the finished house and examine its structure, the materials used, and even make some changes *while you're living in it*. You're not changing the original blueprint, but you're inspecting and interacting with the built structure.

**How Dagger Uses Reflection:**

1. **Finding Annotations:** Dagger uses reflection to "read" your compiled code and find the annotations you've placed (like `@ActivityScope`, `@Component`, `@Inject`, etc.).  These annotations act as markers, telling Dagger how to handle dependencies.

2. **Creating Objects:**  Based on these annotations, Dagger figures out which objects need to be created, how to provide them, and how their lifecycles should be managed.

3. **Dependency Injection:** Dagger uses reflection to find places in your code where dependencies (objects that other objects rely on) are needed. It then injects the correct instances of those dependencies into the right places.

**In Essence:** Reflection gives Dagger the power to understand your code's structure and the relationships between different parts of your app at runtime. This allows it to dynamically manage object creation, lifecycles, and dependency injection without you needing to write all the tedious "plumbing" code yourself. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Why We Need the `inject()` Function**

1. **Connecting to the Component:**
    - Dagger components act as providers for your dependencies. However, components themselves don't magically inject those dependencies into your classes. You need a way to tell a component: "Hey, this class needs some of the objects you manage!"
    - The `inject()` function provides this connection point.

2. **Specifying Injection Targets:**
    - By having an `inject()` function that accepts your `MainActivity` as a parameter (`fun inject(activity: MainActivity)`), you're explicitly telling the `ActivityComponent`: "This `MainActivity` instance needs dependencies that are within your scope."
    - Dagger uses this information during compilation to generate code that knows how to satisfy the dependencies declared in your `MainActivity`.

**What the `inject()` Function Does (Behind the Scenes)**

While you don't usually implement the `inject()` function yourself (Dagger generates the implementation), here's what it does under the hood:

1. **Locates Injectables:**  When you call `component.inject(this)` inside your `MainActivity`, Dagger analyzes the `MainActivity` class, looking for fields marked with `@Inject`.

2. **Resolves Dependencies:**  For each `@Inject` field it finds, Dagger determines:
    - What type of object needs to be injected.
    - How to obtain that object from the component's modules or other provided dependencies.

3. **Performs Injection:**  Finally, Dagger uses reflection to access the `@Inject`-annotated fields in your `MainActivity` instance and assigns them the correct, fully constructed dependency objects.

**In Summary**

- The `inject()` function acts as a bridge between your Dagger component and the classes that need dependency injection.
- It tells Dagger which classes to analyze for injection points (`@Inject` annotations) and provides a way for Dagger to inject the dependencies at runtime.
- This approach keeps your application code loosely coupled from the specifics of dependency resolution, making your code more testable and maintainable. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q:
In the code you have written above, if there were 10 "@Provides fun" in the "ActivityModule" class and they provided other types of objects, would it be possible to use all of these objects in the MainActivity after the line:
"component.inject(this)" ?

You're spot on with your understanding!

**Yes, if you had 10 (or more!) `@Provides fun` methods in your `ActivityModule`, providing different types of objects, you could use *all* of those objects in your `MainActivity` after calling `component.inject(this)`.**

Here's why this works so elegantly with Dagger:

1. **Component as a Central Hub:** Your `ActivityComponent` acts like a central hub, gathering all the dependencies (objects created by `@Provides` methods) from its associated modules.

2. **`inject(this)` as a Request:**  When you call `component.inject(this)` inside your `MainActivity`, you're essentially saying, "Hey `ActivityComponent`, please give my `MainActivity` access to any dependencies it needs, as long as you (or your modules) know how to provide them."

3. **Dagger's Dependency Resolution:** Dagger analyzes your `MainActivity` looking for `@Inject` annotations. It then matches those requests for dependencies with the `@Provides` methods it finds within the component's modules. If there's a match (and the scopes align), Dagger will inject those dependencies.

**Example:**

```kotlin
@Module
class ActivityModule {
    // ... 10 @Provides fun methods for different object types ... 
}

@ActivityScope
@Component(modules = [ActivityModule::class])
interface ActivityComponent {
    fun inject(activity: MainActivity) 
}

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() { 

    @Inject lateinit var someObject: SomeObject 
    @Inject lateinit var anotherObject: AnotherObject
    // ...  @Inject fields for other object types ...

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        // ...
        val component = DaggerActivityComponent.create()
        component.inject(this) // Get all those dependencies! 

        // Now you can freely use someObject, anotherObject, and any other injected dependency
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- **Flexibility:** This approach keeps your `MainActivity` decoupled from the exact implementation of how dependencies are created. You just express what you need (`@Inject`), and Dagger takes care of the rest.
- **Testability:** It becomes much easier to test your `MainActivity` in isolation because you can provide mock dependencies during testing.
- **Maintainability:**  If you add or change dependencies in your project, you only need to update your modules and components, leaving your `MainActivity` (and other classes using injection) relatively untouched. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q:
Ok. rewrite the code when I have 3 activities and each of them have dependencies using Dagger and Kotlin. Explain step to step of the implementation.

Here's a complete example with three activities, each having its own dependencies, using Dagger in Kotlin:

**Step 1: Project Setup**

1. Make sure you have Dagger 2 added as a dependency in your `build.gradle` (Module level):

   ```gradle
   dependencies {
       implementation("com.google.dagger:dagger:2.44") // Use the latest version
       kapt("com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.44") // or any newer version available
   }
   ```

**Step 2: Define your Activities**

```kotlin
import android.content.Intent
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import android.os.Bundle
import android.util.Log
import javax.inject.Inject

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    @Inject lateinit var analytics: Analytics

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        DaggerAppComponent.create().inject(this)
        analytics.trackEvent("MainActivity - Created")

        val intent = Intent(this, SecondActivity::class.java)
        startActivity(intent)
    }
}

class SecondActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    @Inject lateinit var userRepository: UserRepository

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_second)

        DaggerSecondActivityComponent.factory().create().inject(this) 
        userRepository.getUserData() 
    }
}

class ThirdActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    @Inject lateinit var networkService: NetworkService

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_third)

        DaggerThirdActivityComponent.factory().create().inject(this) 
        networkService.makeApiRequest()
    }
}
```

**Step 3: Create Your Dependencies**

```kotlin
class Analytics {
    fun trackEvent(event: String) {
        Log.d("Analytics", "Event tracked: $event")
    }
}

class UserRepository {
    fun getUserData() {
        Log.d("UserRepository", "Fetching user data...")
    }
}

class NetworkService {
    fun makeApiRequest() {
        Log.d("NetworkService", "Making API request...")
    }
}
```

**Step 4: Create Dagger Modules and Components**

```kotlin
import dagger.Component
import dagger.Module
import dagger.Provides
import javax.inject.Singleton

@Module
class AppModule {
    @Singleton // Provide a single instance throughout the app
    @Provides
    fun provideAnalytics(): Analytics = Analytics()
}

@Singleton // Application-level scope
@Component(modules = [AppModule::class])
interface AppComponent {
    fun inject(activity: MainActivity)
}

@Component
interface SecondActivityComponent {
    fun inject(activity: SecondActivity)

    @Component.Factory // Factory for SecondActivityComponent
    interface Factory {
        fun create(): SecondActivityComponent
    }
}

@Component
interface ThirdActivityComponent {
    fun inject(activity: ThirdActivity)

    @Component.Factory // Factory for ThirdActivityComponent
    interface Factory {
        fun create(): ThirdActivityComponent
    }
}

@Module
class SecondActivityModule {
    @Provides
    fun provideUserRepository(): UserRepository = UserRepository()
}

@Module
class ThirdActivityModule {
    @Provides
    fun provideNetworkService(): NetworkService = NetworkService()
}
```

**Step 5: Establish Connections (Dependency Injection)**

```kotlin
// Inside your Activities (MainActivity, SecondActivity, ThirdActivity), you've already added:
// ... in onCreate() ...

// For MainActivity:
DaggerAppComponent.create().inject(this)

// For SecondActivity:
DaggerSecondActivityComponent.factory().create().inject(this)

// For ThirdActivity:
DaggerThirdActivityComponent.factory().create().inject(this) 
```

**Explanation:**

- **Modules:** Modules (`AppModule`, `SecondActivityModule`, `ThirdActivityModule`) are responsible for providing dependencies. They tell Dagger how to create instances of classes.
- **Components:** Components (`AppComponent`, `SecondActivityComponent`, `ThirdActivityComponent`)  are interfaces that act as bridges between modules and the classes that need dependencies. They have `inject()` methods for each activity.
- **Scopes (`@Singleton`):**
   - `@Singleton` is used for `Analytics` to ensure there's only one instance throughout the app's lifecycle.
   - You didn't specify a scope for the other activities' dependencies, so Dagger creates new instances each time they are injected.
- **Injection:** In each activity's `onCreate()`, you create the relevant component and call its `inject()` method, passing in the activity instance (`this`). This triggers Dagger to inject the dependencies.
- **Component Factories:** We use `@Component.Factory` for `SecondActivityComponent` and `ThirdActivityComponent` to create instances of these components easily. This is a common pattern for non-singleton components.

Now, each activity can use its injected dependencies. This setup promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability in your Android project. 
----------------------------------------------------
Q: Why and when do we use @Component.Factory?

Short answer: when we have parameters and also multiple dependencies in the module that depend on that/thosw parameters, in order to avoid boilerplate code, we use it (Iwrote this line, may have mistakes).


Gemini answer: Excellent question! `@Component.Factory` is a powerful feature introduced in Dagger 2.22 to enhance the way we create component instances, especially for components that are *not* singletons (i.e., we might need to create multiple instances of them).

**Why Use `@Component.Factory`?**

1. **Constructor Parameterization:** It provides a clean and type-safe way to pass parameters (dependencies) into your component's constructor. This is particularly useful when:
   - You need to provide dependencies from outside the Dagger graph (e.g., from an activity that's not managed by Dagger).
   - You want to create different instances of a component with slightly different configurations.

2. **Improved Testability:** By using a factory, you decouple the component creation logic from the component itself. This makes it easier to write unit tests where you can mock or provide specific dependencies to your component during testing.

3. **Alternative to `@BindsInstance`:** Before `@Component.Factory`, `@BindsInstance` was used for constructor parameters. However, factories provide a more flexible and readable solution, especially as the number of parameters grows.

**When to Use `@Component.Factory`**

Consider using `@Component.Factory` in these scenarios:

- **Activity- or Fragment-Scoped Components:** You often want to create new instances of these components for each activity or fragment, potentially passing in dependencies like the `Context` or other activity-specific objects.
- **Components with Configuration:** If your component's behavior depends on certain parameters, you can pass those parameters through the factory's `create()` method.
- **Improving Testability:** When you need finer control over component creation during testing to isolate dependencies or provide mocks.

**Example:** (from our previous example)

```kotlin
@Component
interface SecondActivityComponent {
    fun inject(activity: SecondActivity)

    @Component.Factory
    interface Factory {
        fun create(): SecondActivityComponent 
        // You could add parameters here if needed, e.g.,
        // fun create(@BindsInstance someDependency: SomeType): SecondActivityComponent
    }
}
```

Here, `SecondActivityComponent.Factory` allows you to create instances of `SecondActivityComponent`. In this case, it doesn't take any parameters, but you could add them to customize the component instance.

**In Summary:** `@Component.Factory` gives you more flexibility and control over component instantiation in Dagger. It's a good practice to use it for non-singleton components, especially when you need to provide external dependencies or configure the component on creation.

--------------------------------------------------------

Alright. Now, if I have a Class names "ClassD" and I want to use a scoped instance of this class object in 3 activities inside my android application so that the three instances are different but each are scoped to one of the activities, how should I write the code using dagger and kotlin?

Here's how you can achieve scoped instances of "ClassD" for each of your three activities, ensuring each activity gets its own instance that lives as long as the activity itself:

```kotlin
import android.content.Intent
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import android.os.Bundle
import android.util.Log
import javax.inject.Inject
import dagger.Component
import dagger.Module
import dagger.Provides

// 1. Define an Activity-Level Scope 
@javax.inject.Scope 
annotation class ActivityScope

// 2. Create Your ClassD
class ClassD @Inject constructor() { 
    private val id = (0..1000).random() // Just for demonstrating unique instances

    init {
        Log.d("ClassD", "Instance created with ID: $id")
    }

    fun doSomething() {
        Log.d("ClassD", "Doing something with ID: $id")
    }
}

// 3. Define Activity Modules
@Module 
class MainActivityModule {
    @ActivityScope
    @Provides
    fun provideClassD(): ClassD = ClassD()
}

@Module 
class SecondActivityModule {
    @ActivityScope 
    @Provides
    fun provideClassD(): ClassD = ClassD()
}

@Module 
class ThirdActivityModule {
    @ActivityScope 
    @Provides
    fun provideClassD(): ClassD = ClassD()
}

// 4. Create Activity Components
@ActivityScope
@Component(modules = [MainActivityModule::class])
interface MainActivityComponent {
    fun inject(activity: MainActivity)
}

@ActivityScope
@Component(modules = [SecondActivityModule::class])
interface SecondActivityComponent {
    fun inject(activity: SecondActivity)

    @Component.Factory 
    interface Factory {
        fun create(): SecondActivityComponent 
    }
}

@ActivityScope
@Component(modules = [ThirdActivityModule::class])
interface ThirdActivityComponent {
    fun inject(activity: ThirdActivity)

    @Component.Factory 
    interface Factory {
        fun create(): ThirdActivityComponent 
    }
}

// 5. Your Activities
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    @Inject lateinit var classD: ClassD

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        // ... 
        DaggerMainActivityComponent.create().inject(this)
        classD.doSomething() 
        // ...
    }
}

// SecondActivity and ThirdActivity would have almost the same structure as MainActivity
// Each would have @Inject lateinit var classD: ClassD
// and in onCreate(), they would create their respective components and inject themselves.
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`@ActivityScope`:** We create a custom scope annotation to define the lifecycle of our `ClassD` instances. Objects annotated with `@ActivityScope` will live as long as their corresponding activity.

2. **`ClassD`:** Our class that we want to have activity-scoped instances of.

3. **Activity Modules:** We create separate modules (`MainActivityModule`, `SecondActivityModule`, `ThirdActivityModule`) for each activity.  This isn't strictly required, but it's a good organization practice, especially as your project grows. Each module has a `@Provides` function for `ClassD`, annotated with `@ActivityScope`.

4. **Activity Components:** Each activity gets its component (`MainActivityComponent`, etc.), also annotated with `@ActivityScope`. These components depend on their respective modules.

5. **Activities:**
   - Inside each activity, you inject `classD` using `@Inject`.
   - In `onCreate()`, you create the activity's component and inject the dependencies.

**Key Points:**

- **Scope Alignment:**  By aligning the `@ActivityScope` on the component, the `@Provides` methods, and the component's `inject()` method, we ensure that Dagger creates a new instance of `ClassD` each time an activity is created and that this instance lives only within that activity's scope.

- **Component Factories:**  We use `@Component.Factory` for the `SecondActivityComponent` and `ThirdActivityComponent` to make it easier to create component instances.

Now, when you run your app, each activity will have its own unique instance of `ClassD`. You can verify this by checking the log output - you should see different IDs logged for each activity. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Remember:
You use @Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME) always when you are defining a custom scope annotation to be used with Dagger. (Like one of the above examples).
